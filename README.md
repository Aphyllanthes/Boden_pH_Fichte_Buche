# Boden_pH_Fichte_Buche
This is the research-project of the master-course "Freiland√∂kologie".

We used this as "cloud" to share our R-codes and data with the members of the group-work.
The project is about the spatial distribution of the soil-pH on a plot that is domitated by spruce on the northern half and beech in the southern half.

The final report is the file pH_Nadel_zu_Laub.Rmd.
